Overview:
I've created a virtual coffee machine that allows users to order drinks (espresso, latte, or cappuccino) and handles the entire process.
The machine keeps track of resources (water, milk, coffee) and calculates profits.
Technical Aspects:
Dictionaries: Iâ€™ve used dictionaries to define the menu (MENU) and available resources (resources).
Functions:
is_resource_sufficient(order_ingredients): Checks if there are enough ingredients for a drink.
process_coins(): Calculates the total value of coins inserted.
is_transaction_successful(money_received, drink_cost): Determines if payment is sufficient.
make_coffee(drink_name, order_ingredients): Updates resource quantities after making a drink.
Loops and User Interaction: The while loop keeps the program running, and users input their choices.
Global Variables: profit tracks earnings from successful transactions.
In summary, this coffee machine project showcases practical coding skills, resource management, and user-friendly interaction.
